A typing test measures the test-taker's typing speed and accuracy. Typing tests usually give one or more paragraphs for the typer to copy within a certain time frame.
Based on how fast the tester is able to copy that passage, and the amount of errors they make while typing it, is summed up as results at the end of the typing test.
Flash Type is a specific typing test that will utilize data analysis and imported modules using Python.
To play, the program's first line will have the words "Type the following line: "
The words after that are the sentence(s) that the tester will need to type out.
The sentence afterwards will be "press ENTER when you are ready to test :)", prompting the user to press the enter key to begin the countdown.
Once you finish typing the sentence, click enter to show you are finished. 
Afterwards, the next line will show how many errors you have, and the line after that will show how many seconds it took to type the sentence.
This process will continue multiple times to test various sentences. 

#Include a picture of examples when the Python program is finalized 

To sum up the directions:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> Look at the sentence next to "Type the following line: " </li>
	<li> Press enter to start typing. </li>
	<li> Type the sentence above to the best of your ability. Press enter again when done. </li>
	<li> The program will show you the number of errors and time taken. The next sentence to practice typing will also be provided. </li>
	<li> Repeat steps until the typing test is over. </li>
