<p> 
Hello! This is the main landing page for Flash Type. Our team, Kit Kat Juice, aims to create a Python program that functions as a typing speed test (with a GUI), which will test how fast the user can type a random sentence (created through a program like generate_text and displayed one line at a time) based on characters/words per minute. At the end of the round error frequency analysis and the typing speed computations will be displayed (this will be made possible with the `time` module).
The random sentences generated for the user to test themselves on are taken from various text files from Project Gutenberg.   
</p>

<p>
A typing test measures the test-taker's typing speed and accuracy. Typing tests usually give one or more sentences/paragraphs for the typer to copy within a certain time frame.
The program collects data on how fast the tester is able to copy that passage and the amount of errors they make while typing it. This data is displayed at the end of the typing test.
Flash Type is a specific typing test that will utilize data analysis and imported modules using Python.
To play, the program will display the sentence that the user needs to copy. Make sure to click on the black text box before typing. Once the user finishes typing the sentence, 
click enter to go to the next sentence. This process continues until the typing test is over, when the results of the typing test will then be generated. 

To sum up the directions:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> When the page loads, look at the sentence in colored text. </li>
	<li> Click on the black text box, to start typing. </li>
	<li> Type the sentence above to the best of your ability. Press enter when done. </li>
	<li> The next sentence to practice typing appear. </li>
	<li> Repeat steps until the typing test is over, when the results will be given. </li> 
</ol>

<a id= "Works"><h3> How it Works </h3> </a>
<p> Flash Type will take a randomly generated sentence from one of the chosen texts (see the Files section for more info on the texts used). The user will retype that sentence.
The program will assess how correct the user's sentence was (such as any errors they made when compared to the original sentence).
The Time module and program calculations will be based on one line at a time, and this data is then scaled to record wpm (words per minute).

	<p> Flash Type uses two Python modules: Pygame and time. </p> 
	<ul>
		<li> 
		Pygame: The Pygame library was implemented so that there is a user-friendly interface for the program. Since Pygame is generally used for developing games in Python, implementing Pygame into Flash Type would help make the typing test more user-friendly. To see the official Pygame documentation repository,
		<a href= https://github.com/pygame/pygame> click here. </a>
		Also, 
		<a href= https://www.pygame.org/docs/> this website </a>
		has a general overview of Pygame. 
		</li> 
		<li> time: The time module will help with determining calculations, such as typing speed, after each round of typing ends. This allows the results at the end of the typing test to be more accurate, such as assessing how much time elapsed throughout the typing rounds.
		<a href= https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html> This website </a>
		gives an overview of the time module.
		</li> 
		<li> Statistics: This library was imported to find the mode of the erorr list and to find the most frequent error. Information about the statistics can be found
		<a href = https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html> here. </a>
		</li> 
	</ul>
<a id= "bugs"><h3> Bugs/Errors/Things to be Aware of </h3> </a>
	<ul>
		<li> Since the sentences are randomly generated, this means that the length of the sentences for each round can vary. While this is to create for a more varied test, this also means some sentences may be of shorter or longer length than others. </li>
		<li> The timer allows the user to go a few seconds over the time limit (this can lead to slightly imprecise data, but is compensated). </li>		 
	</ul>
