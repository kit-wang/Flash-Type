<h3> Project Overview/Description </h3>
<p> 
Hello! This is the main landing page for Flash Type. Our team, Kit Kat Juice, aims to create a Python program that functions as a typing speed test (with a GUI), which will test how fast the user can type a random paragraph (created through a program like generate_text and displayed one line at a time) based on characters/words per minute. At the start of each “round” of the typing test will have a mini-section that allows the user to choose the next text they will be tested on. At the end of the round, should the user choose to end it, error frequency analysis and the typing speed computations will be displayed (this will be made possible with the `time` module).
The random sentences generated for the user to test themselves on are taken from various text files from Project Gutenberg.

		<li> final.html : This html file </li>
		<li> Flashtype.py : The main Python file that makes up the typing portion, using components such as the GUI (explained further in a section below). </li>
		<li> errors.py : The Python file that calculates the number of errors and percentage accuracy based on the total number of words. </li> 
	</ul>
	<h3> Resources </h3>
	<p> Flash Type uses two Python modules: Pygame and time. </p> 
	<ul>
		<li> 
		Pygame: The Pygame library was implemented so that there is a user-friendly interface for the program. Since Pygame is generally used for developing games in Python, implementing Pygame into Flash Type would help make the typing test more user-friendly. To see the official Pygame documentation repository,
		<a href= https://github.com/pygame/pygame> click here. </a>
		Also, 
		<a href= https://www.pygame.org/docs/> this website </a>
		has a general overview of Pygame. 
		</li> 
		<li> time: The time module will help with determining calculations, such as typing speed, after each round of typing ends. This allows the results at the end of the typing test to be more accurate, such as assessing how much time elapsed throughout the typing rounds.
		<a href= https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html> This website </a>
		gives an overview of the time module.
		</li> 
	</ul>
	<h3> Bugs/Errors/Things to be Aware of </h3> 
	<ul>
		<li> Since the sentences are randomly generated, this means that the length of the sentences for each round can vary. While this is to create for a more varied test, this also means some sentences may be of shorter or longer length than others. </li>
	</ul>
